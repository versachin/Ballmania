# Ballmania
Ball Game Sachin Palta
BIG PICTURE
On startup there should be random obstacles. With the press of a button, the ball should jump up and forward 100. 
User can keep pressing the enter key to avoid obstacles, or they can lose and have to start over again. User gets a higher score by avoiding more obstacles, and going for a longer time. User loses by hitting one of the generated obstacles.
The first time the user gets past one minute of the game, they are rewarded 100 energy points. After that, every time they beat their high score, they would get 50 energy points, and when they get to 2 minutes, they would be rewarded another 100 energy points, and the same with 3 minutes, and so on. 
If user gets to 10 minutes of play time then they would beat the game, and would not be able to get any energy points. They would have a choice of starting the game over, or keep playing just for fun. The game should get progressively faster as the game goes on.

FIRST ROUND
During the first round what I hope to accomplish is to get the turtle moving with the keys, and to make some obstacles, where if the turtle hits it it says crash

TEST PLAN FOR FIRST ROUND
When the turtle hits an obstacle it should say crash
When I click the up arrow the turtle should move forward
When I click the left or right arrows, it should rotate in that direction

REFLECTIONS AND REVISIONS
Instead of making a game where the ball jumps, I want to make more of a maze game. I can use another turtle to stamp onto the coordinates of the obstacles, and when the turtle hits it it should say crash

NEXT STEPS
I want to use the turtle to make a maze. This way I can easily create obstacles. Once I create obstacles maybe I can add a way to score points, and more levels.
